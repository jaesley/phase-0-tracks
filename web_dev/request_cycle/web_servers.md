What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
  Linux is free, an open-source OS in comparison to Mac and Windows systems that are owned and operated by companies. It also relies heavily on user freedom, even at risk of system damage; and it runs primarily via command line interfaces rather than the limiting GUIs of other OS programs.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
  Because Linux provides very few, if any, limits on user power, and on the root user's power in particular, it's extremely easy to damage the system via root user privileges. The root user is presumed to be a sysadmin who knows what they're doing, and thus has unfettered access--for better or for worse.
